# command-line-compass
Ubuntu Touch @UBports based cl compass. It is running in my version of atlast. Compile atlast on a raspberry pi and copy over to phablet directory on the mobile using e. g. scp

The compass has man overboard functionality. Current location can be saved and later get distance and bearing to that saved place.
